Version 4.3.10
- Residual water amplitude now listed in csv results output and expressed as a percentage of unsuppressed water signal in the PDF output (HSVD based water removal for SVS data only).
- Bug fix to allow dyn freq correction to be applied with auto referencing set to false.
- Add to c/l and GUI option to keep the pre water suppression shift (can be a useful alternative to "auto referencing" when the residual water signals are poorly suppressed).

- Bug fix for k-space filtering of 2D MRSI with odd number of voxels in a given direction.

Version 4.3.9

Version 4.3.8
- New command line option to append pdf output with a stack plot (--stack_pdf true). A very useful contribution from Stephen Wastling at KCL.
- New internal basis set including experimentally derived MM basis signal. May give more stable results for normal(ish) brain at 3T, TE~30ms.

- Internal basis set for braino phantom now has narrower peaks better suited to typical T2 values seen in solution.
- Bug fix for unit tests.

Version 4.3.5
- Tentative support for DICOM, SPAR/SDAT, IMA and RDA formats for 3D MRSI.
- Dynamics scans can now be filtered prior to averaging by specifying a csv file (--av_list). Useful for fMRS studies.
- Bug fix for GUI where program crashes following fitting.
- Bug fix for GE p-files Rdb reader rev : 14.3 and 16.0 where the offset to data was incorrect by one frame. This caused a crash at the reconstruction stage.

- Bug fix for where dynamic WS scans didn't match W scans.
- Added c/l option to estimate CRLB noise level from the frequency domain (--crlb_td false).
- Added gnuplot pdf export option to the GUI - only tested for Linux and OSX, Windows users will probally need to add gnuplot to the path or specify location with "--gnuplot".

- Exporting single voxel water data from an MRSI data set is now possible in the GUI.
- Added GUI options to export single voxel CSV results and fit from an MRSI data set.

- Improvement to reduce memory use when exporting large csv fit data files.
- Bug fix where Cit was included in the default basis set for the GUI.
- Bug fix for GE p-files where the offset to data was incorrect for rdb_header_rev 24,20. - Thanks to Felix Raschke for pointing this out.
- Modest SNR improvement for multi-channel GE SVS coil combination (now weighted by water amplitude where available). Thanks to Felix Raschke and Jamie Near for letting me know that this is a better approach than un-weighted combination.
- Improvements to default MRI window level and window width parameters.
- Improvements to SPAR/SDAT SVS and 2D MRSI display on MRI.

Version 4.3.3

- CRLB calculation has been improved
- More flexible options for averaging dynamic water data
- Dynamic SVS can now be read from dpt files

Version 4.3.1
- 2D MRSI gui visualisation is much improved:
    - New interactive grid display.
    - SVS and 2D MRSI VOI's can now be overlayed with MRI. This should work for Philips/Siemens DICOM and Siemens IMA.
    - Simple metabolite ratio maps can now be displayed.

This is a significant change and is very likely to have introduced some bugs. Please do not trust the geometry or make any important decisions based on the display. There may be all kinds of incorrect left-right-up-down swaps, shifts and rotations. 

- Water removal has been improved for spectra where the water peak is not at 0Hz.
- Eddy current correction is now applied before water removal, this improves the water removal quality in some cases.
- Fitting is now approx. 4x faster.

Version 4.2.11
- Added the option to export and read LCModel basis files
- Bug fix for DICOM MRS with explicit sequence lengths.
- Corrected peak shift output to be the correct sign.
- Added some QA type parameters to csv output.
- Updated eigen to version 3.1.1.
- Tuned soft constraints to give an improved baseline for some short TE spectra.
- Bug fix for reading Bruker data where the data file is not called "fid" - thanks to Bartosz Kossowski for spotting this.
- Bug fix for old Philips SPAR/SDAT files with "SUN_dim1_ext" style parameter names.
- Added svs_only parameter to c/l. When set to true, TARQUIN will exit rather than try and fit data where more than one fid is in the file. This can be handy when MRSI datasets mistakenly end up in SVS batch jobs.
- Added write_raw_w option to c/l. This allows automated generation of ascii format SVS data.
- Added final Phi0 and Phi1 values to pdf and csv output
- Increased default Phi1 limit to 20 deg/PPM
- Added a new internal basis set "proton_brain_full" including standard metabolites plus PCr and PEth

- Upgrade QWT - TODO
- Export multi-page PDFs for dynamic scans - TODO

TODO next version +1
- Better nStart basline point av estimation, make an array, important for SE CSI 
- Define new txt based basis format inc groups and dynamics?
- Add DC offset correction option (apply in preprocessing part of analysis)
- Add options for HSVD water removal (bool), filter water removal (bool) and auto inital beta guess (bool)
- Add option to multiply first point of FID by 0.5 (default no)
- Have voxel display showing current voxel and fit-list voxels in particular colors, changing the slice box should change the slice shown in voxel display
- add export gnuplot fit to gui?
- Look at 3D CSI data
- Check full echo-data and swap row columns features for 3D and col != row cases
- Siemens DICOM MRS needs swap row col for WS and WUS?

Version 4.2.10
- A TARQUIN application bundle has been developed for Mac OS X, see the documentation for how to use the command-line version in OS X. Big thanks to Andreas Bartsch, Adrian Garcia and Paul Mullins for testing.
- Basis set shifts and dampings are now exported in the CSV results file.
- Dynamic frequency shifts are now exported in the CSV results file when correction is performed.
- Regression fix where an odd number of dynamic FIDs could not be loaded.
- Regression fix where jmrui txt files could not be loaded.
- Crash fix for k-space zero-filling a non-square acquisition.
- Better error handling for bad CSV basis files.
- DICOM MRS Columns and Rows tags now take precedence over SpectroscopyAcuisitionColumns and SpectroscopyAcuisitionRows.
- Once data has been successfully loaded in the gui, a new data set can not be loaded "over the top". This should prevent some crashes.
- gnuplot_cex command line parameter added. For some reason font sizes are differed between gnuplot 4.4 and 4.6 so this option has been added. A character expansion (cex) of 2 looks good for version 4.6.
- Windows bug fix where some RDA files don't load.


Version 4.2.9
- Added editing for PRESS TE1, STEAM TM and CPMG pulse number parameters.
- Bug fix for incorrect DC offset correction for Varian data.

- Added WUS freq to output.
- GE SVS "frames" are now treated as dynamic scans and can be fit individually or just averaged and fit as normal.
- When there is a mismatch between the number of water suppressed and water unsuppressed FIDs the water unsuppressed FIDs are averaged and then duplicated to match the number of water suppressed FIDs.


Version 4.2.8
- Spectra can now be manually phased and ppm referenced in the gui after the preprocessing phase
- Automatic phasing and referencing can be disabled in the advanced fit dialogue
- Increased the precision of the sampling frequency, transmitter frequency and echo time options from 6 to 12 digits in the advanced fit dialogue. This fixes minor fitting differences between the quick fit and advanced fit dialogues.
- Added row, col and slice controls to the gui for improved navigation of CSI data
- All CSI voxels can now be viewed and selected/deselected for subsequent analysis
- Added line-broadening, zero-filling and baseline smoothing options to the gui and command line options. These now influence the exported csv spectra and gnuplot pdf exports. Note - these are postprocessing parameters only and will not change quantitation results.
- The Philips DICOM MRS reader has been improved for dynamic and non-localised data
- A rare bug causing TARQUIN can hang in the NNLS part of the algorithm has been fixed, thanks to Antonin Skoch for helping out with this
- Added ext_pdf option for outputting pdf plots of individual fitted basis signals
- Bug fix for some spectra where initial phasing was 180 degrees out
- Preprocessing phasing code should be more robust to poor data
- The first data point for the simulated signals is now divided by 0.5, reducing the distance between the data and baseline. (see Otting et al 1986 JMR 66, 187-193 for details).
- Eddy current correction is now appied after water removal (when selected) and an option has been added to the gui.
